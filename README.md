# 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Unbeatable Bot using Minimax)

This project implements a classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game where a human player competes against an **AI opponent**. The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to make optimal moves, making it **unbeatable**.

---

## 📌 Overview

The purpose of this project is to understand and apply **game theory**, **search algorithms**, and **decision-making logic** using the Minimax algorithm. The game allows a human to play against a perfectly optimal AI in a turn-based interface.

The AI explores all possible future moves, evaluates game states, and always selects the most favorable one—either to win or to block the opponent.
